Person 1: Fengyuan Zhang
Person 2: Yuxi Liu

Brief description: In this assignment, we create a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game without win-condition. The original plan is to use "X" , "O" to represent the chess. However, when we worked on it, we found int_array will be easier for this assignment instead of char_array. Hence, we use "0" and "11" to express the chess.
